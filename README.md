# multicareneurologymeetings

This repository will house the summary of meeting agenda discussion for the Neurology division of Multicare.  Matt will be responsible for maintaining this but all neurology staff are encouraged to contribute.  I will create a new branch for each meeting.  Simply select the branch of the appropriate month to access the summary document.  Depending on success/interest I can set this up to publish to a website each month so that interested parties can simply bookmark the site. I can add a login to keep the page more private if we feel that would be helpful.
